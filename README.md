# Gold Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts gold prices using economic indicators and machine learning models — specifically **Random Forest Regressor** and **Gradient Boosting Regressor**. 
It features an interactive **Streamlit web app** allowing users to analyze model performance and make predictions based on custom input.

## Technical presentation:
The models are trained on publicly available datasets and evaluated using Random Forest and XG Boost Algorithm. 
The deployment is done via Streamlit for interactive access to predictions.

## Business-focused version:
This solution aims to provide traders, analysts, and financial institutions with a reliable tool for anticipating future movements in gold prices using accessible market data.

## Suggested Problem Statement:
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts the price of gold (GLD) based on key financial indicators such as the S&P 500 index (SPX), 
Crude Oil prices (USO), Silver prices (SLV), and the EUR/USD exchange rate. By leveraging supervised regression algorithms—specifically Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Regressors—the 
model aims to assist in financial forecasting and investment decision-making by providing reliable predictions of gold prices.
